Welcome to Meditation Island. Sit back, relax and let your mind wander. Isn't this Better Than Life?

Meditation Island is our first in a series of high-fidelity meditation experiences. Our aim was to raise the bar of meditative experiences in VR to truly transport you to a beautiful dream location.
Birds high up in the sky, waves rolling in on the shore, the wind blowing through palm trees and plants that grow on your private secluded island all contribute both visually and in sound to a surreal experience that practically makes you feel the ocean breeze.

The experience features a dynamic day and night cycle, with a cozy campfire that turns on when the sun sets. The cycle can be adjusted to your liking, both when in the day youâ€™d like to start as well as the speed of day progression. 

You are guided by a meditative voice uniquely tailored to the island environment to help ease you into this truly immersive experience.

<a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07RWHQ14P">My Carer</a> is an innovative skill built to support people in the early stages of dementia. The skill is created for both patients and loved ones. With My Carer they can set up daily reminders for the person living with dementia, enabling them to live more independently.

You will be able to set up daily reminders for tasks such as:
- Taking Medication
- Meal Preparation
- Preparing for Appointments
- Calling friends and family for their Birthday

The skill supports the patient with step-by-step interactive guidance until each task is completed. My Carer for Amazon Alexa aims to give an affordable and convenient solution for people living with dementia, especially in the early stages of the disease. It's also intended to make life easier for carers and loved ones.

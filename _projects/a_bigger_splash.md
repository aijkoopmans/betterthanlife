Our first project was a tribute to David Hockney’s iconic painting ‘A Bigger Splash’. We recreated the painting as true to the original style as we could, actually making the environment feel like it had
Been painted by Hockney’s brushstrokes. We start off in a typical museum environment and as the user walks up they are sucked into the painting.  Our interpretation takes place before the actual splash depicted in the painting, instead letting the user be the imagined cause of the splash by jumping into the pool. 

This experience showcased a playful way in which we think museums can utilize VR to engage younger audiences with the optional addition of a voice-over giving more context for the original painting.

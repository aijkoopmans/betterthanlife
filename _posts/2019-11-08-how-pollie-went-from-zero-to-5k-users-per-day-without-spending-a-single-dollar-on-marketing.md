In February we launched <a target="_blank" href="https://www.pollie.app/">Pollie</a>: a simple app which let users create polls and share it with others.

*Daily app users (via Firebase)*

*Daily voters (via Analytics)*

### Non-English App Stores
We researched the saturation of polling apps in app stores in different countries. The English app stores (i.e. United States, United Kingdom) were already saturated with polling apps, but non-english speaking countries offered opportunities. By picking the right keywords (thanks to Google Translate) and localizing the screenshots, these countries became our top countries in terms of app users:
<ul>
	<li>Brazil</li>
	<li>Germany</li>
	<li>Italy</li>
	<li>Russia</li>
</ul>
